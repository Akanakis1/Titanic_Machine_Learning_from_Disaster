## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of **Titanic passengers** using machine learning algorithms on passenger data, including age, sex, fare, class, and family relations. It features extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple models with automated best-model selection.

## üîç Motivation

The Titanic dataset is a classic ML challenge: predicting survival from structured data reflecting social, demographic, and economic factors. This project refines baseline efforts through advanced feature engineering (e.g., titles, family size, deck extraction) and compares tree-based and linear models to improve predictive accuracy.
